                <p>
                  Mike Moceri's career catapulted in 2012 when he co-founded 3DPX, the world's first 3D printing retail service bureau. This Chicago-based startup gained global recognition for its unique blend of retail and production, signifying a new era in 3D printing services, on-demand manufacturing, and product design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Building on this success, Moceri ventured into Detroit's manufacturing industry by establishing Manulith in 2014. Manulith offered a comprehensive suite of services ranging from design and rapid prototyping to production for the automotive, aerospace, medical, consumer products, and industrial application sectors within the Great Lakes Region.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2018, he expanded his footprint further by converting Manulith to MakerOS. As an industry-leading software-as-a-service platform, MakerOS served small to mid-sized design, engineering, and manufacturing firms. It digitized their workflow from initial client interaction to project management, production, and payments. As of 2022, MakerOS proudly served over 10,000 businesses globally.

Mike is currently focusing his 15+ years of management and entrepreneurial experience to new horizons with R&D in AI application development, the integration of advanced manufacturing workflows, and scalable business ventures in the new AI paradigm.
